#MineableSpawners

This plugin allows players to mine spawners with silk touch (or not, see description) and have them go to their inventory so that they can trade or place them. This system uses the item lore to keep track of the spawner type.

Make sure to check the configuration if you want to disable the permission checks for certain features.

Current features:
- Define if a user needs silk touch or not to break and drop spawners.
- Change spawner type by looking at it and using /spawner (mob).
- Give spawners by using /spawnergive (player) (mob) (amount).
- Enable/Disable changing spawner types with spawn eggs.

Permissions:
- Break a spawner with silk touch: mineablespawners.break
- Break a spawner without silk touch: mineablespawners.break & mineablespawners.nosilk
- Access to /spawner (all mobs): mineablespawners.spawner
- Access to /spawner (specific mobs only, do not give the above permission): mineablespawners.spawner.<mob name>, for example mineablespawners.spawner.chicken
- Access to /spawnergive: mineablespawners.give
- Ability to change spawners with spawn eggs: mineablespawners.eggchange
