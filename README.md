# MineableSpawners
Simple silkspawners like plugin for 1.13 since its not updated yet.

Basically when you mine a spawner with a silk touch pickaxe, you get that spawner in your inventory with a lore specifying which spawner type it is.

Then once you place spawners, it checks for the lore and updates to that type.

Checks for full inventories and cancels the block break if you are not using silk touch to prevent loss.

Also if you do /spawner (type) for example /spawner cow while looking at a spawner and having the permission "mineablespawners.spawner", it will update the spawner type.
